# Admin API Reference

The Admin API provides a set of powerful endpoints for system maintenance and management. By default, the Admin API service is separate from the User API and runs on a different port (which must be enabled and configured in `config.yaml`).

## Authentication

The current version of the Admin API has **no built-in authentication mechanism**. It is crucial to ensure that the Admin API's listen address is **only accessible from trusted network environments (e.g., an internal network or localhost)**, or to add an authentication layer using a reverse proxy.
