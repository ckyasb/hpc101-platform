# Problem Config (problem.yaml)

Each problem is defined by a separate directory, the path of which must be declared in the `problems` list of its parent `contest.yaml` file.

A problem directory must contain a `problem.yaml` file and an `index.md` file for the problem statement. It may also contain an `index.assets/` directory for static files (e.g., images referenced in the statement), which is managed via the Admin API.

## Directory Structure Example

```

...
├── problem.yaml   \# The core configuration file for the problem
├── index.md       \# The problem statement in Markdown
└── index.assets/  \# (Managed by API) Static assets for the statement

```

## `problem.yaml` Examples

### Example 1: Standard Scoring

This is a configuration for a classic A+B problem using the standard file upload and a fixed-point scoring system.

```yaml
# The unique ID for the problem
id: "aplusb"

# The name of the problem
name: "A+B Problem"

# Independent open time for the problem (optional)
# If set, it takes precedence over the contest time, but must be within the contest's time range
starttime: "2025-10-01T09:00:00+08:00"
endtime: "2025-10-01T12:00:00+08:00"

# Maximum number of valid submissions per user for this problem. 0 means unlimited.
max_submissions: 10

# Specifies the scoring rule. Defaults to "score".
score:
  mode: "score"

# Limits on user-uploaded files (optional)
upload:
  upload_form: true # Enables the file upload component on the frontend
  maxnum: 2    # Max number of files allowed
  maxsize: 1   # Max total size for all files in MB

# Judging resource configuration
cluster: "default-cluster"  # Specifies which cluster to judge on
cpu: 1                      # Number of CPU cores to request for judging
memory: 256                 # Amount of memory (in MB) to request for judging

# The judging workflow
workflow:
  # Step 1: Compile the C++ code
  - name: "Compile"
    image: "gcc:latest"
    root: false
    timeout: 10
    show: true
    network: false
    steps:
      - ["g++", "main.cpp", "-o", "main"]

  # Step 2: Run and judge
  - name: "Run & Judge"
    image: "zjusct/oj-judger:latest"
    root: false
    timeout: 5
    show: false
    network: false
    mounts:
      - type: bind
        source: "/path/on/node/testcases/aplusb" # Path on the judger node
        target: "/data"                         # Path inside the container
        readonly: true
    steps:
      # This hypothetical command runs the user's program and prints the result JSON to stdout.
      - ["/judge", "--input", "/data/input.txt", "--ans", "/data/ans.txt", "./main"]
```

### Example 2: Performance-Based Scoring

This problem uses a dynamic scoring rule where a user's score is relative to the best-performing submission.

```yaml
id: "performance-example"
name: "Performance Optimization"
max_submissions: 5
cluster: "default-cluster"
cpu: 1
memory: 256

# Configure the scoring mode to "performance"
score:
  mode: "performance"
  # Define the maximum score a user can get (i.e., the score for the top performance)
  max_performance_score: 120

# Configure the online editor
upload:
  editor: true
  editor_files:
    - "main.cpp"
    - "CMakeLists.txt"
  maxsize: 1 # Max total size of 1 MB for all editor content

workflow:
  - name: "Compile"
    image: "gcc:latest"
    timeout: 10
    show: true
    steps:
      - ["cmake", "."]
      - ["make"]
  - name: "Judge"
    image: "zjusct/oj-judger:latest"
    timeout: 5
    show: false
    steps:
      # The judger for a performance problem should output a "performance" metric.
      # The system will then calculate the "score" based on this metric.
      - ["/judge", "./main"]
```

  - **Required**: Yes
  - **Description**: A globally unique identifier for the problem.

-----

### `name`

  - **Type**: `string`
  - **Required**: Yes
  - **Description**: The display name of the problem.

-----

### `starttime` / `endtime`

  - **Type**: `string` (ISO 8601 format)
  - **Required**: No
  - **Description**: The independent start/end time for the problem. This is useful for contests where problems are unlocked in stages. If set, this time window must be within the parent contest's `starttime` and `endtime`.

-----

### `max_submissions`

  - **Type**: `integer`
  - **Required**: No
  - **Default**: `0` (unlimited)
  - **Description**: Limits the number of valid submissions a user can make for this problem.

-----

### `score`

  - **Type**: `object`
  - **Required**: No
  - **Description**: Configures the scoring mechanism for the problem.
      - `mode`: (string) The scoring mode to use.
          - `"score"`: (Default) The judger directly returns a `score` value.
          - `"performance"`: The judger returns a `performance` value (a number), and the system calculates the score based on the ratio of the user's performance to the current best performance across all users.
      - `max_performance_score`: (integer) **Required** when `mode` is `"performance"`. This is the score awarded to the submission with the highest performance.

-----

### `upload`

  - **Type**: `object`
  - **Required**: No
  - **Description**: Configures the submission method and its limits. One of `upload_form` or `editor` should be true.
      - `upload_form`: (boolean) If `true`, the frontend will display a file upload interface. Defaults to `false`.
      - `editor`: (boolean) If `true`, the frontend will display an online code editor. Defaults to `false`.
      - `editor_files`: (array of strings) When `editor` is `true`, this lists the filenames that will be shown as tabs in the online editor. The content from these editors will be submitted as files with these names.
      - `maxnum`: (integer) The maximum number of files a user can upload in a single submission.
      - `maxsize`: (integer) The maximum **total size** in **megabytes (MB)** for all files in a single submission.

      - `timeout`: (integer, required) The total timeout for this step, in seconds.
      - `show`: (boolean) Whether to allow regular users to view the logs for this step. Typically, compile logs are public (`true`), while judge logs (which might contain test case info) should be hidden (`false`). Defaults to `false`.
      - `network`: (boolean) Whether to enable network access for this step's container. Defaults to `false` (network disabled).

### Judge Result JSON Format

The **final step** of the workflow is responsible for reporting the result by printing a JSON object to **standard output**. The required fields in the JSON depend on the `score.mode`.

#### `score.mode: "score"`

The JSON must contain a `score` field. A `performance` field can be included but will be ignored by the scoring system.

```json
{
  "score": 100,
  "info": {
    "message": "All test cases passed",
    "time_usage_ms": 50,
    "memory_usage_kb": 1024
  }
}
```

  - `score`: (integer, required) The final score awarded for this submission.
  - `info`: (object, optional) Any additional information you wish to store and display.

#### `score.mode: "performance"`

The JSON must contain a `performance` field. A `score` field can be included but will be ignored.

```json
{
  "performance": 153.28,
  "info": {
    "message": "Calculation finished",
    "iterations": 1000000,
    "time_usage_ms": 120
  }
}
```

  - `performance`: (number, required) A metric indicating the quality of the solution. A higher value is considered better. The system will automatically calculate the final `score` based on this value relative to other users.
  - `info`: (object, optional) Any additional information to store and display.
